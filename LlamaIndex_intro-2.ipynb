    "# Introduction to LlamaIndex: High-Level Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this workshop on LlamaIndex! Before we dive into the code, let's explore some key concepts that will help you understand how LlamaIndex works and what it can do for your LLM-powered applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LlamaIndex?\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex is a data framework designed to help developers build applications with large language models (LLMs) that can interact with external data sources. It provides tools for data ingestion, structuring, indexing, and querying, bridging the gap between LLMs and custom datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex supports four main categories of use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structured Data Extraction**: Extract precise data structures from unstructured sources like PDFs and websites.\n",
    "2. **Query Engines**: Ask questions over your data and get responses with referenced context.\n",
    "3. **Chat Engines**: Have multi-turn conversations with your data.\n",
    "4. **Agents**: Create LLM-powered decision-makers that can complete complex tasks using a set of tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a fundamental concept in LLM workflows It allows you to augment LLM knowledge with your own data. The RAG process typically involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading your data\n",
    "2. Indexing the data (often using vector embeddings)\n",
    "3. Storing the indexed data\n",
    "4. Querying the data\n",
    "5. Evaluating the results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "As you work with LlamaIndex, you'll encounter these key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nodes and Documents**: Containers for your data at different levels of granularity.\n",
    "- **Connectors**: Tools to ingest data from various sources.\n",
    "    - You can even use LLMs themselves as a way to read and determine whether data gets ingested, summarized and ingested, or ignored.\n",
    "    - For this notebook we're using SimpleDirectoryReader, but there are others like DatabaseReader, which runs a query against a SQL database and returns every row of the results as a Document. There are hundreds of connectors to use on LlamaHub. ![Llamahub](llamahub.png)\n",
    "- **Indexes**: Structures to organize your data for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "    - **Vector Store Index** (most common but there are others):\n",
    "\n",
    "        Splits documents into Nodes\n",
    "        Creates vector embeddings of each node's text\n",
    "        Enables semantic search\n",
    "        Uses \"top-k semantic retrieval\" for querying\n",
    " \n",
    "      We're using faiss, but there are many others such as chromadb, and pinecone. Choosing them is based on factors like cost, speed of input/output, accuracy, and scalability. \n",
    "      \n",
    "    - **Knowledge graph**\n",
    " \n",
    "        A Knowledge Graph Index in LlamaIndex represents data as a network of interconnected entities and **relationships**. This index type is particularly useful for:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Modeling complex, interconnected data structures\n",
    "        Capturing relationships between different pieces of information\n",
    "        Enabling more contextual and relationship-based querying\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embeddings**: Numerical representations of your data's meaning.\n",
    "    - **Vector embeddings**:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Numerical representations of text semantics\n",
    "        Allow finding related text based on meaning, not just keywords\n",
    "        Default embedding in LlamaIndex is OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 **we're using BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 for it's high scoring  on benchmarks, but the default works just fine.** Each embedding model has a dimension, or length of the floating point that meaning is stored as. it is important to make sure that your embedding model, and your vector store dimensions are compatible. \n",
    "         \n",
    "    - **Embedding process**:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Can be time-consuming and potentially expensive for large amounts of text\n",
    "        It's recommended to store embeddings for future use (vector store) **its possible to set up your RAG the wrong way** and it will embed your entire dataset every time you ask a question. seconds to hours of lost time. \n",
    "- **Retrievers**: Methods to fetch relevant context from your index.\n",
    "    - Usually, your prompt to an LLM gets embedded and a similarity search is performed between your query and the nodes in the datastore. There are many other retrieval strategies.\n",
    "    - chunk size: how much text is in each node.\n",
    "    - chunk overlap: how much text from the previous and next chunks are represented in the current chunk.\n",
    "    - top_k: number of chunks returned, usually ranked by most relavant (semantic similarity).\n",
    "- **Routers**: Tools to select the appropriate retriever for a given query.\n",
    "- **Node Postprocessors**: Functions to transform, filter, or re-rank retrieved nodes.\n",
    "    - Postprocessing is when the Nodes retrieved are optionally reranked, transformed, or filtered, for instance by requiring that they have specific metadata such as keywords attached.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **Response Synthesizers**: Components that generate LLM responses using retrieved context.\n",
    "    - Response synthesis is when your query, your most-relevant data and your prompt are combined and sent to your LLM to return a response.\n",
    "    - Users may expect that the final response contains some degree of structure (e.g. a JSON output, a formatted SQL query, etc.)\n",
    "      \n",
